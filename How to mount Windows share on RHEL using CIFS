Rhel nas file share
To create a file share using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, you can use the following steps:

Install the necessary packages:
sudo yum install samba samba-client samba-common -y
Configure the Samba service:

sudo systemctl enable smb.service
sudo systemctl start smb.service
Create a directory that you want to share:

sudo mkdir /data/share
Set the permissions on the shared directory:

sudo chmod -R 777 /data/share
Open the Samba configuration file for editing:

sudo vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
Add the following lines at the end of the file:

[share]
comment = Shared Directory
path = /data/share
browseable = yes
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
Note: You can replace "share" with any name you want to use for the share.

Save and close the file.

Restart the Samba service:

sudo systemctl restart smb.service
You can now access the file share from other computers on the network by entering the RHEL server's IP address followed by the share name in the file explorer, for example:

\\192.168.1.100\share
Note: Make sure that the RHEL server's firewall is configured to allow Samba traffic.
