Download the 64-bit Linux Unified Host Utilities software package from the NetApp Support Site to your host.

Use the following command to install the software package:

rpm -ivh netapp_linux_unified_host_utilities-7-1.x86_64

SAN Toolkit
The toolkit is installed automatically when you install the NetApp Host Utilities package. 
This kit provides the sanlun utility, which helps you manage LUNs and HBAs. 
The sanlun command returns information about the LUNs mapped to your host, multipathing, and information necessary to create initiator groups.

# sanlun lun show all

Multipathing
For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. 
RHEL 8.6 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

You can use the multipath -ll command to verify the settings for your ONTAP LUNs.

Recommended Settings
The RHEL 8.6 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly for both ASA and non-ASA configuration.

The multipath.conf file must exist for the multipath daemon to start, but you can create an empty, zero-byte file using the command:
touch /etc/multipath.conf

The first time you create this file, you might need to enable and start the multipath services.

# systemctl enable multipathd
# systemctl start multipathd

vi /etc/multipath.conf

defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }
}



Run the following command to determine the WWID:

# /lib/udev/scsi_id -gud /dev/sda
360030057024d0730239134810c0cb833
Add this WWID to the blacklist stanza in the /etc/multipath.conf:

blacklist {
     wwid   360030057024d0730239134810c0cb833
     devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
     devnode "^hd[a-z]"
     devnode "^cciss.*"
}
